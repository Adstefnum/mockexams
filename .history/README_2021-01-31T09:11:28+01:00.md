### scraping past questions

- The question dirrectory contains past questions to be used for testing the backend.
- The scrape.py script scrapes a particular site for past questions from 2001 to a specified year above 2001.
- The site scrape.py scrapes does not have past questions from about 2013 downwards so i will write another script to scrape past questions from some pdfs with me.
- To use the scrape tool type ```python3 scrape.py the subjects you want to scrape```
- Note you can scrape more than 1 subject at a time.

### structure of the backend

- You are free to use any database of your choice for the backend
-
